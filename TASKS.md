## Testing Policies

- Use **Jest** and **React Testing Library** for unit and integration tests.
- Cover success, edge, and failure cases.
- Mock external services (Supabase, payment APIs).
- Place tests alongside components or in `/tests`.
- Tests must pass before merging pull requests.
- Integrate tests with CI pipeline.
- Avoid real secrets in tests; use mocks or env vars.
